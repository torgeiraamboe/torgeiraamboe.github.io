      <description>This blog-post is dedicated to this day, $\pi$-day (14th of march), where we celebrate $\pi_*$, the stable homotopy groups.
As has been the case a couple of times already, when faced with an increased workload I tend to neglect writing on this blog. It is only natural that increased amounts of work in one section lead to a decreased amount of work in another — there is, after all, only a finite amount of time given to us.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the last blog post we introduced and studied adapted homology theories. Given a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{A}$ an abelian category with enough injectives together with a local grading $[1]\colon \mathcal{A}\longrightarrow \mathcal{A}$, an adapted homology theory is a functor
$$ H\colon \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow \mathcal{A} $$
such that $H$ is additive, sends fiber sequences to long exact sequences, sends the suspension $\Sigma$ of $\mathcal{C}$ to the shift $[1]$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and such that we can lift injectives in $\mathcal{A}$ into $\mathcal{C}$ through $H$.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the last post we studied homology theories as abstract functors from stable $\infty$-categories to abelian categories. We showed that for every stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ there is a universal homology theory which all others factor through, namely the Yoneda embedding into the Freyd envelope,
$$ y\colon \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow A(\mathcal{C}). $$
The fact that this is universal means that for any homology theory $H\colon \mathcal{C}\longrightarrow \mathcal{A}$ there is an essentially unique factorization</description>

      <description>New year; same me; new math. During the fall I said that I wanted to post on this blog monthly, but that did not happen for some reason. I thought I’d try again this semester, but maybe I am setting this not that high bar still too high for my self. For some reason there seems to be fewer hours in the day than it used to. The cover page for the post is generated by Dalle·2 using the prompt &amp;ldquo;A man finding the universal piece, old painting&amp;rdquo; – a true work of art.</description>

      <description>This semester I am taking part in a seminar on $\infty$-categories, administered by Rune Haugseng. So far we have covered roughly: the basic definitions, fibrations, limits, colimits, Joyal’s lifting theorem, equivalences, straightening, Yoneda lemma, adjunctions and Kan extensions. This week it is my turn to give a talk on stable $\infty$-categories, and this blog post will hopefully be some sort of lecture notes for this talk. The intersection of things in this post and the contents of the talk should at least be non-empty.</description>

      <title>The stable homotopy category</title>

      <description>A little while ago we discussed the definition of a tensor triangulated category, and in that post we mentioned an example that we didn&amp;rsquo;t explicitly define, namely the stable homotopy category. The goal for todays post is to fix this. There are many ways of defining it, and some are actually better than others. As the name suggests, the stable homotopy category is a homotopy category, which we have discussed before in the fibration series.</description>

      <description>For the last five years mathematics has been my passion, as well as my main focus in life. This passion for mathematics will hopefully not diminish, as I am now heading into four more years of studies and research through a PhD in mathematics at NTNU. I am joining a project, called Tensor triangulated geometry in Trondheim, so today I thought I would explore the definition of one of the main players in this theory, namely tensor triangulated categories.</description>
